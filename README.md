### Dionaea Honeypot Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** In simple terms, Dionaea is a tool that traps malware exploiting vulnerabilities and exposed services going towards a network. Security professionals use a tool such as this in order to gain a copy of the malware and perhaps do sandbox analysis of said malware, but in our case we used it to catch port sniffers.
